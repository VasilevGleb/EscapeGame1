so, what it is about? idk just tryed to make mini-game. Right now is nothig more as like 5 buttons and text render, but i still working on more rooms and story.

01.02.2026 today I made some more work with buttons and understood that my code shouldn`t be to difficult to read or to complicated. And now it`s easy to understand, has simple functions. I`m satisfied

06.02.2026 at the moment I understood that it is to much of "if" "else if", but I dont know how I can make it with another way. Because of it, I asked my Chat-GPT about another possibility. The script1 since today is invaild. I will writhe it from new
